For issues with libraries:

20241126 VS Code environment setup (Problem: Library not loaded: @rpath/libssl.3.dylib)
Solution:
Set Compiler Flags Ensure the required environment variables for compilers are set:
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/libpq/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/libpq/include"

Set PKG_CONFIG_PATH Update the PKG_CONFIG_PATH for tools that use pkg-config:
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libpq/lib/pkgconfig"

Update DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH Add libpq to the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libpq/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"

Below solution stopped working before fully resolving the imports.
- I already spent 1,5 days figuring out the same issue on pycharm. Now it took me just 2 hours. Below seems to be the solution:

Step 3: Set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
The dynamic linker on macOS uses DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to find libraries. Update this path to include OpenSSL's library location.

Temporarily set it for the current session:

bash
SOLUTION:
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

To make this permanent, add it to your shell configuration file:

bash (this didn't work)
echo 'export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
